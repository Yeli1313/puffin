## Introduction
Firebase which is owned by Google provide multiple set of features more specifically focused on Mobile app and gradually bringing new features for web apps as well. 
Having a glance the URL : https://firebase.google.com/ can tell you every list of features they offer. Apart from confidential notes, we use firebase to allow you to

- We use App Distribution to share pre-release built with you, so you can share with your team to test the app before it get's published
- It does bring you out of box features like Dynamic Links, Predictions, Cloud Messaging, etc.

Firebase done a good job of explaining each features through a short video on every page you navigate, so you will be educated if this is the first time you are using Firebase.
